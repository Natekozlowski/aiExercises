# Your task for today is to write a Python program that swaps the keys and values in a dictionary. That means turning something like 
# {'a': 1, 'b': 2} into {1: 'a', 2: 'b'}.
# This exercise is very useful in real-world Python work. For example, you might have a dictionary where usernames are keys and user IDs 
# are values â€” and you want to reverse it to look up usernames by ID instead.
# In this project, you'll be start by storing a sample dictionary in a variable. Here is your dictionary:
# original = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
# Your goal is to loop through it (or use a one-liner) to build a new dictionary where each value becomes a key 
# and each key becomes the value.
# Output
# {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}

original = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}

swapped = {value: key for key, value in original.items()}

print(original)
